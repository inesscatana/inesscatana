 <p>⚡ Fun fact: Tired of North Korean films being box office flops, Kim Jong-il, a dictator with a flair for drama, went full Hollywood. In 1978, he kidnapped top South Korean director Shin Sang-ok and his actress ex-wife Choi Eun-hee, forcing them to make films in North Korea. When hiring talent becomes literal kidnapping, you know the stakes are high!</p>
